<h2>Week 2</h2>
    <h3>Week 2 consisted of learning some html, css, and pseudocode. I felt pretty comfortable doing all of the
      assignments for that since
      I first learned about them in the intro course. I am still having issues while moving files from the local source
      to remote but I am confident that I will figure it out before this class is over. The pseudocode was a little
      frustating because I felt like there are a lot of different ways it can be done.</h3>

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <h3>Week 2 consisted of learning some html, css, and pseudocode. I felt pretty comfortable doing all of these since
      I first learned about them in the intro course. I am still having issues while moving files from the local source
      to remote but I am confident that I will figure it out before this class is over.</h3>

    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <h3>During the first week, we learned mostly about how to use Github. I am confused about pretty much all of it.
      Also, I hate blogs. Listening to Slayer and Pantera has been helpful.</h3>
